# hello-world
My introduction to GitHub.

I'm brand-spanking new to coding. 
Over the next several months I will be learning the fundamentals.
I am very interested in coming to understand algorithms and making them myself. 
I hope to meet people who can help me and who I can, hopefully, help later.
